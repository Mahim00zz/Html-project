    <h2 style= "color:tomato;text-align:center;"> Evidences</h2>
    </div>
     <p> One of the first evidence that shows how the new system called linguistic system works is: Linguistic is a system so it can use new approaches such as grammar,word choice, punctuation and complexity of a writer to identify fake news.One of the biggest advantages is that using linguistic stystem would help us identify fake news faster than an avarage human would.</P>
    <p>Another evidence that compares human and technology's ability to identify fake news is: Humans were able to find and identify fake news with a success rate of 70% and on the other hand the linguistics system was able to show a 76% success in find fake news information.</P>
    <p>Finally another evidence that shows the validity of the linguistic system devolopers statistics is: in a Michigan University, a research study found out that the linguistic system had a 76% success rate by using 500 unique real and fake news. This proved that the statistics linguistic devolopers proposed were true.</p>
