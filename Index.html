    <h2 style= "color:tomato;text-align:center;"> Evidences</h2>
    <p> One evidence that shows that differentiating fake news and real news is hard is when one research done by Stanford University "Researchers, found that young students, ranging from middle to high school, had a hard time distinguishing good sources of information from questionable ones".</P>
    <p> Another evidence that demonstrates statistics that shows how fake news can be hard to identify is "82 percent of students from diffrent studies, couldnâ€™t differentiate sponsored content from a real news story".</P>
    <p> Final evidence that shows expands our thinking of the dangers of fake news is "It might be worse among the broader public, which is composed of more people who spend less time-consuming news, are less interested in current events and lack higher education"</p>
