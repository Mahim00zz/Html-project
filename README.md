Hello everyone, this is my first HTML project. CREATED DATE- 08-12-18

I created this website to learn about HTML and CSS. I designed this website with the agenda to share a message, which is "DO NOT TRUST EVEYTHING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET". 
The internet is a tool we all use in our daily life and being in school I had to rely on the internet a lot to form my opinions. As useful as the internet can be it can also be
very dangerous. Information spread very quick through the web and our human tendancy to quickly jump to conclutions can be very harmful to us. Thus, I am taking this oportunity to educate
my fellow web surfers to be aware and always look for reliable sources.
